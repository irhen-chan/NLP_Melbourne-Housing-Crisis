reforms will be implemented through this Bill and through
complementary regulations, the making of which will be
authorised by amendments carried by this Bill. Complementary
regulations will prescribe education requirements. Once
complementary regulations have been made, relevant training
organisations will need adequate lead-in time to bring training
units to market and property industry professionals will need time
to undertake the training
