No exceptions. Can't afford it? You can't afford the place.

And attend the inspection if you can, because hopefully you can lose some rose coloured glasses from the sales inspection.

This, we did 10 of the fuckers when we were looking, but with 3 of them we were told not to buy from the inspector due to various serious issues, the houses looked totally fine to us and we probably would have bought otherwise.

Biggest investment of your life, don‚Äôt mess about.

I just got back my first B & P inspection tonight. It wasn‚Äôt good üò© Very thorough, so very thankful for it and totally worth it.

Did you get better at spotting issues yourself as you went along?

Yes and no, like the place we bought had some dodgy brick work, the builder was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a facade, it‚Äôs fine‚Äù - we thought it was much more serious.

It‚Äôs a buyers market at the moment so you can use any defects to try and get the price down a bit. We got $10k off ours because the bathroom floor was supported by a bed frame lol.

May I ask, how did you use it to get the price down? I assume that only works if the issue is logged as a major defect and so you could therefore walk away? Or did you do the B&P before the offer? (About to make my first offer on a place with B&P condition)

Offer subject to building and pest. So it came back and the conveyancer said we want X off and they agreed. But we had a lot of debt collectors come looking for them in the years after, so we could have probably asked for $50k off. But hindsight is 20/20.

Deposit doesn't factor in as much as anyone thinks when getting loan approval. Loan approval is primarily based on capacity to service (pay back) the loan. which is based on income, not savings. Deposit just means you'll borrow less than they approve you for. Because with rates at the moment, it is risky to take the full loan whatever that may be.

30-35% of income towards the loan monthly is a good target, lower the better obviously. Above 35% doesn't give you much room to also make some savings. 40%+ things could get really tight and leave little room for emergencies, either personal, or property based.

Rates should go down by April/May, but they will go up above what they are now over a 30 year loan.

Don‚Äôt buy north of $600K. Prioritise the location over the fancy features.

That‚Äôs about it.

Unfortunately at $600k in Melbourne you don't get to prioritise the location...

Yes you do. Obviously you won‚Äôt be choosing b/w south yarra, toorak, surrey hills etc

But still, location is key. $600K unit in the right area is better than a $600k freestanding in another.

Add 10-15% to the top of the quoted range so you don‚Äôt waste your time. Partner and I just bought our first house and we were approved for 900k loan.

We were interested in the first place we saw which was going to auction listed at 720-780k. We won at auction for 860k. I tracked other properties in the area in the weeks before and they all went from 9-14% above the top of the listed range. We avoided the disappointment and massive amounts of time taken to find a place doing this. Doing this we bought the first place that we saw and liked.

I also used two valuation companies prior to sales of properties to see how accurate they are (core logic and Pricefinder). Comparing actual sale results with these estimates gives you a good idea of what to expect.

Familiarise yourself with the process of contracts and types of sale and get a conveyancer if you don‚Äôt have one. You‚Äôre paying them so ask whatever questions you want to. Run everything by them if you are going to make offers (pre auction or for sale).

Don‚Äôt get sucked in to agents tactics or give any information you shouldn‚Äôt. With that being said agents are just doing a job for the vendor. We purchased a place that we were stoked with and the vendors were very happy with the price. No one lost. Don‚Äôt buy into all agents are evil they are just doing a job.

Think about how much negotiating 5,10,15k is worth over the life of the loan and losing out on a place you like. If you do the calculations you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs quite negligible.

If you‚Äôre buying a place to live ignore the noise of the market and whether it‚Äôs going down or up. If you can afford repayments it will always be better to own then the alternatives.

Good luck

Talk to lots of agents . Ask questions you already know the answer to to see how much they lie.

Start a spreadsheet of every place you look at. Note the listed range, what you think it will go for and finally what it actually went for.

Sold price searching on RE.com will be very helpful.

If you get a good repport with an agent ask if they can notify you before it's listed online. I was able to inspect properties while they were doing the photo shoot three or four days before they got listed.

An agent's dream scenario is selling the place a day or two after they've signed the vendor

Enjoy the search. It‚Äôs a perfect time to buy, prices are dropping fast (most, some still seem to fetch at the upper end of the range). The part about adding 10-25% to the top of the range ? No longer true. We‚Äôve been looking 3 months and agents are calling us to bargain down . We have seen offers well under market win.

Edit: applies to 2br 2bth 1 parking, inner south east , also inner north

Yep I agree, we‚Äôre looking in Melbourne at the moment too and have seen plenty of places sell within or even below the guide price, some do still sell above guide of course. If you blanket add a % on top of guide prices you may well end up over spending. You need to be on top of comparative sales and figure out what a property is worth yourself, ignore the guides and online price estimates.

Check crime maps. You should have an idea of the worst suburbs. But the ones that fly under the radar can also be bad to buy in.

Always put a decent chunk more towards your mortgage rather than what's asked. This helps with rate changes, and if you have an offset account, you can have backup when needed.

2 things I thought of when looking: you either like it or you hate it. Where does it sit on a scale of 1-10. 1 - 5 being walk out, 6-8 negotiable, 9 - 10, shut up and take my money.

If you're looking at apartments and townhouses, what is body corporate like. Cost and sinking fund. How do the common areas look? Are they maintained?

Don‚Äôt over capitalise. Location is 80%. Buy something ugly in a good location and slowly make it pretty. If negotiating make sure you have Leverage/ a plan B. If you pay 10-20k over ‚Äúwhat it‚Äôs worth‚Äù you will never regret that. Don‚Äôt let your pride get in the way of a lifelong decision.

You'll need another 70k. Deposit is 70k but you're going to need another 10% for settlement.

The deposit and settlement isn't the same. You can't get a loan over 80% of the value of the property. So even if you have 10%, you still need to make sure you have another 10% to cover the remaining sum.

You can get a loan up to 95% of the property value, you just pay mortgage insurance (insuring the bank, not you), usually added on top of the loan, your rate is much higher, and your borrowing capacity is much lower.

pretty sure you can buy at 90% - just means you have to pay mortgage insurance ( but that was 5 years ago )

Currently going through the process, the broker did 80% of the total price for my application. I wouldn't recommend OP do 90%.

NAL but work in conveyancing in VIC.

The best thing you can do is engage a lawyer or conveyancer to do a contract review for any property you're seriously thinking of purchasing, particularly if you're looking at bidding at auction and don't have the normal protections like a cooling-off period.

Make sure you have loan pre-approval so that you can hit the ground running when you need to get formal approval after signing a contract. Building and pest inspections are generally worth doing.

The reviews and inspections can involve upfront costs that might seem like a lot (hundreds of dollars), but when compared with how much you're spending for a property the amount is pretty negligible. A lot of properties are fine from a contract/vendor statement perspective and from a building and pest perspective, but when it's bad, it can be really bad.

Good luck!
