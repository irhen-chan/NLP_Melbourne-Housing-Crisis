Victoria’s Housing Statement
The decade ahead | 2024-2034

Right across the
nation, housing is
one of the biggest
challenges we face.
The latest data shows that in June
this year, housing affordability in
Australia crashed to its lowest in
30 years. Successive interest rate
hikes and booming house prices
mean it’s harder than ever to
service a mortgage.
Today, if you’re a household
earning a median income
of $105,000, you could likely
only afford around 13 per cent
of homes on the market – that’s
the lowest share since this data
was first collected almost three
decades ago. And the situation for
low and middle income families
is much worse. A household
earning $64,000 a year could
now afford just 3 per cent
of homes on the market.
At the same time, prospective
renters at a home inspection will
find they’re just one of dozens of
applicants. Demand for rentals is
skyrocketing – and so is the price.
Rents across the country are rising
at the fastest rate in 15 years.
Annual rent increases peaked at
10 per cent in late 2022 and early
2023. The last time rent went up
this quickly was when peak annual
rent growth hit 9.7 per cent during
the global financial crisis.
The status quo isn’t an option. If we
don’t act now, Victoria will end up
falling short – by more than 25,000
homes each year over the next
ten years. That means more house
prices skyrocketing, more families
priced out of the market, and more
competition for rental properties.
It all comes back to supply. It’s a
simple reality: as a country, we
need to do more to build enough
houses for all of the people who
need them. Because it’s only when
there are enough homes to go
around that more people will be
able to afford them.
As a state, we’re going to get
on with it – quickly. Victoria
is the fastest growing state
in the country: our population
is expected to reach 10.3 million
by 2051. Melbourne is set to
become Australia’s biggest city
by the end of the decade, with the
population estimated to grow by
an additional 2.9 million people
over the next 28 years.
If we’re going to make sure the
current problem doesn’t get worse,
we need to build 1.6 million homes
by 2051 – that’s around 57,000
homes a year. To ease the acute
pressure people are currently
facing, we need to deliver 2.24
million homes by 2051 – that’s
around 80,000 a year.
On current trends, we are expected
to build around 540,000 homes
over the next decade. The work
we’re doing in this Housing
Statement will facilitate an extra
250,000 homes being built in
Victoria over the next ten years –
and it’ll support 16,000 jobs.
We’ll give planning the resources
they need, making sure good
decisions are made faster. We’ll
then reform Victoria’s planning
system so projects don’t get stuck
again. We’ll build up and out –
making sure Victorians can afford
to live where they want, close to
where they work, in thriving and
sustainable communities. We’ll
strengthen protections for renters,
because every Victorian deserves
a comfortable home – whether
you own it or not. We’ll build more
social and affordable housing for
the Victorians who need it most.
And because this statement forms
the first step of our work to boost
housing supply and affordability –
not the last – we’ll develop a long
term plan to guide the way our
state grows.
Most importantly, we’ll bring
Victorians along for the journey.
We’ll keep consulting with the
community, industry and local
councils to make sure every
Victorian has the opportunity to
shape our state for the generations
who follow us. And we’ll keep
working with the Commonwealth
Government and other states
and territories to form a national
solution to one of our nation’s
greatest economic challenges.The status quo isn’t an option. If we

Good decisions, made faster

Reforming Victoria’s planning system to boost
housing supply in every corner of the state
Clearing the backlog of planning permits waiting
to be approved – and standardising rules to make
sure good decisions are made faster
Giving builders, buyers and renovators certainty
about how long approvals will take – and
a clear pathway to resolve issues quickly
if those timeframes aren’t met


Victoria is growing. We’re the fastest growing state in
Australia, with our population set to hit 10.3 million by 2051.
By the 2050s, Melbourne will be home to more than eight million people, and regional Victoria
will be home to more than 2.3 million. But the fundamental truth is this: we’re not building
enough homes for all of the people who will need them in years to come.
Right now, the system just isn’t working like it should – and decisions aren’t getting made
fast enough. At a council level, there’s a backlog of around 1,400 planning permit applications
for multi-unit housing that have been sitting with councils for more than six months waiting
for a decision. Some 550 of those applications have been sitting with councils for more than
a year.
Instead of decisions being made by councils, more and more planning disputes are taking
longer and longer and ultimately ending up at unelected VCAT to resolve. That clogs up the
system even more – and results in more delays for the people who genuinely need to use it.
All of that means we’re going backwards. Over the last year, the number of dwellings approved
across the state fell by 26.1 per cent. Victorians deserve a planning system that works with
them – not against them. It should be quick, efficient, and easy to navigate. It should be a clear,
transparent and accountable system – because Victorians deserve to know who is planning
our city and state.
And we’ve got a plan to do just that

Builders right across Australia are facing critical global
economic challenges, including rising supply chain costs.
This year, we announced a package of reforms to better
protect Victorians building a home, while also giving our
local building industry the certainty it needs.
Here’s what we’re doing:
Consumer focus: We’re putting consumers and homeowners at the centre
of the system with clearer roles and responsibilities, greater accountability,
access to insurance, and consumer support throughout the lifecycle of a build.
Strong regulators: We’re ensuring the people who oversee building projects
have the powers they need to protect consumers and hold builders to account
if they do the wrong thing.
Skilled builders: We’re making sure builders and contractors have the
rights skills to build our homes, and that they operate with the transparency
and professionalism Victorians expect.
Better approvals: We’re improving the approval process to make sure
all buildings in Victoria are safe and built to last.
We’ve already started making important changes. We’re creating a Building Monitor
to represent consumers’ interests, improving the approval process, and requiring
more people involved in a building project to be registered. The Victorian Building
Authority, with a new CEO, is getting on with its work to improve the performance
of the regulator, drive improvements in the building system, and put consumers
at the centre of all it does. We’re also working on more changes to make it easier
to get insurance, resolve disputes, and enforce the rules. We understand that
building safe, durable homes is the priority
Clear the backlog
Having applications sitting in the system doesn’t get homes built. We’ll begin the work to clear the backlog of 1,400
housing permit applications that have been stuck with councils for more than six months. We’ll have a dedicated team
that works with project proponents, local councils, and referral agencies to resolve issues delaying council decisionmaking – to avoid projects ending up in VCAT and to get homes built. Once we have a clearer picture of projects
and if decisions keep lagging, then the Minister for Planning won’t hesitate to call them in.
Make big decisions faster
We’ll make sure big decisions are made faster by expanding Victoria’s Development Facilitation Program. This will
make the Minister for Planning the decision maker for significant residential developments that include affordable
housing. We’ll streamline the planning process for medium to high density residential developments that meet the set
criteria: construction costs worth at least $50 million in Melbourne or $15 million in regional Victoria, and delivering
at least 10 per cent affordable housing. This will include new build-to-rent projects. It’ll mean around 13,200 additional
homes will be brought to market that would otherwise be delayed – and it’ll cut application timeframes for these types
of projects from more than 12 months down to four.
Increase housing choice in activity centres
We’ll introduce clear planning controls to deliver an additional 60,000 homes around an initial 10 activity centres
across Melbourne: Broadmeadows, Camberwell Junction, Chadstone, Epping, Frankston, Moorabbin, Niddrie (Keilor
Road), North Essendon, Preston (High Street) and Ringwood. Activity centre plans will guide investment in the things
a growing suburb needs like community facilities, public spaces and parks. The program will also consider the best
way to incentivise more affordable housing.
Making it easier to build a small second home
Small second homes on the same lot – also known as granny flats or dwelling garden units – have become more
and more popular. They can give families the space to grow together, provide a critical second income, or give kids
somewhere to stay when they visit for the weekend. But for many, the burden of getting a planning approval has
put building a second small home in the too hard basket. We’ll make it easier to build a second small home on your
property. Dwelling garden units won’t require a planning permit if they’re less than 60 square metres. And we’ll also
introduce more permit exemptions for single dwellings for things like extensions to sheds and carports.

Faster permits and planning certainty
We’ll streamline assessment pathways with a range of new Deemed to Comply residential standards for different types
of homes. Council planners will be able to quickly approve permits for houses that meet the residential standards –
like how much space homes take up on a block, or how much storage a home has – meaning councils will only assess
aspects of a permit that don’t comply with those standards.
We’ll expand the Future Homes program to encourage more new builds. Future Homes provides four sets of readymade architectural designs which can be purchased by developers and adapted to a site through a streamlined
planning process. We’ll create more high-quality designs for 4 and 5 storey developments, and we’ll expand the areas
where they can be used.
We’ll also make changes to the types of homes that require planning permits. Single dwellings on lots bigger than 300
square metres, and not covered by an overlay, will no longer require a planning permit. Single dwellings on lots smaller
than 300 square metres, where an overlay doesn’t exist, will be ticked off within 10 days.
Red Tape Commissioner reforms
We’ll introduce legislative reforms to strengthen our planning system. The legislation will implement Red Tape
Commissioner recommendations, as well as other reforms like giving VCAT the power to dismiss matters without
a prospect of success and imposing time limits on submissions. Planning Panels will also be able to undertake
hearings on the papers and join parties.
Convert commercial buildings to residential
The Property Council of Australia (PCA) and the City of Melbourne have identified close to 80 commercial office
buildings that are currently under-used because of changing work patterns and demand for flexible floor space
increasing. We’ll work with the PCA and the City to consider opportunities to facilitate the conversion of these offices
into around 10,000-12,000 apartments and mixed-use properties.
Provide quicker water connections
As our towns and cities grow, utility connections – like water and electricity – need to happen quickly. We’ll work
to speed up water connections in greenfield areas to get Victorians into their new homes faster. We’ll revise our
statement of expectations to water corporations, strengthening the need to engage with developers and local
councils early and regularly through the permit process – and setting clear timelines these water corporations
need to meet to connect new communities and developments to the essential services they rely on.
More resources to support a faster, fairer planning system
To give industry greater certainty, the Department of Transport and Planning will bolster its resources in the coming
months – including by bringing on 90 new planners – to help with a range of priorities like clearing the backlog, making
good decisions faster and increasing housing choice in activity centres.
