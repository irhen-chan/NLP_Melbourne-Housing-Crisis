There’s something strange going on in the best-located suburbs of our biggest cities. As the national population surges, they are shrinking.

In Melbourne’s affluent east and bayside areas, a swath of suburbs had population declines between 2019 and 2023, even though the city as a whole grew by 4 per cent in that period. It was a similar story in Sydney, where the headcount shrank in districts across the eastern suburbs, lower north shore and inner west.

Inner Sydney and inner Melbourne also have a growing number of “tombstone suburbs”, where deaths consistently outnumber births. In Hunters Hill, a waterfront neighbourhood on Sydney’s lower north shore, there were 113 more deaths than births in 2022-23, while in Melbourne’s well-heeled Camberwell, deaths outnumbered births by 78 that year.

Meanwhile, outer suburbs have been adding people at breakneck speed. The population of Rouse Hill-McGraths Hill in north-western Sydney surged 52 per cent between 2019 and 2023. In the Melton-Bacchus Marsh region in Melbourne’s west, the population jumped 22 per cent over that period.

These trends are warping Australia’s two biggest cities, as outer suburbs are forced to accommodate a disproportionate share of a growing population.

Analysis by leading urban economist Terry Rawnsley shows the inner urban population slump has been driven by the loss of prime-age workers aged between 20 and 64 years. As thousands of inner-city homes designed for families remain underutilised, a legion of young families has little choice but settle in greenfield areas where local employment opportunities are limited and long commutes the norm.

Despite being areas with exceptional access to jobs and excellent local infrastructure, inner-city suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney are seeing a decline in population simply because young people can’t afford to live there,” says Rawnsley, a consultant with KPMG.

While inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney are losing young people, working-age populations in comparable areas of Brisbane and Perth grew strongly between 2019 and 2023.

Yawning differences in the age profiles of inner suburbs and outer suburbs help illustrate what is happening in Melbourne and Sydney. The median age in Melbourne’s bayside suburb of Brighton (48 years) is 17 years older than in Craigieburn in the city’s outer north (31). In Sydney’s harbourside Double Bay-Darling Point, one in every four locals is aged over 65, while at Oran Park in the city’s outer south-west the share is just one in 20.

As more workers are forced to locate long distances from downtown job hubs, the strain on transport and local infrastructure intensifies. Expensive new rail and road projects are needed to move people across the urban sprawl. Adding new homes in established urban areas is also much cheaper than on the outskirts.

The misallocation of resources is sapping productivity citywide and threatens to make Sydney and Melbourne harder places to do business. The exodus of 20-64 year olds also threatens to hit local inner-city economies as the pool of young workers shrinks.

Rawnsley says a 2.5 per cent drop in working-age population – as happened in the eastern suburbs of both big cities between 2019 and 2023 – could feel like a local recession. “We’ve seen what happens in country towns when you get an ageing and shrinking population – businesses like shops and restaurants often have limited hours because they can’t get enough staff. That sleepy coastal town syndrome could easily be imported to some inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney.”

This demographic challenge is exacerbated by plunging birth rates. In Melbourne’s inner east, the fertility rate (the expected number of births per woman) has slumped to just 1.1 – half the 2.1 ‘replacement level’ needed to maintain a stable population, not including migration. Sydney’s inner west is similar, with a fertility rate of 1.3.

The high cost of housing in well-located suburbs is perhaps the biggest factor distorting population growth patterns in Sydney and Melbourne. This is exacerbated by a chronic shortage of supply in these areas. Rawnsley warns housing affordability is now reshaping the urban fabric of Sydney and Melbourne “at a remarkable speed”.

While governments are attempting to lift the housing supply, including the diversity of dwelling-types, it will take many years – perhaps decades – in well-located suburbs.

But a knot of demographic trends is also helping to warp our cities, especially the ageing of the population. Improved life spans means people are occupying well-located homes for longer.

When life expectancy was shorter, say in the mid-70s, housing in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney turned over more quickly,” says Rawnsley. “Now, with life expectancy heading towards 90, housing turnover is taking longer, so we are not used to dealing with how it plays out in the housing market. This is a new problem for us to grapple with.”

Behaviour has also changed. In the past, many retirees permanently left big cities for a sea change or tree change, but more are now staying put near the cultural attractions and high-quality healthcare offered by big cities.

Recent patterns of wealth distribution, underpinned by strong growth in property prices, means many more middle-aged and older people have the money to live at the beach, or in the country, while keeping a crash pad in inner Melbourne or Sydney. This also contributes to the under utilisation of housing in our best-serviced suburbs.

These demographic trends are deep-rooted and will affect Melbourne and Sydney for decades to come.

while in Melbourne’s well-heeled Camberwell, deaths outnumbered births by 78 that year.

As someone whose parents live in Camberwell, the suburb really does feel like a free-range nursing home, especially in the eastern bits.

Considering how prime it is - with tram lines and train stations, and nearby to jobs/unis/hospitals, this is exactly why I have no issue with the recent state government announcement to designate Camberwell an activity centre - overruling local council in building apartments if necessary.

It’s too well connected an area to become a tombstone for wealthy retirees. Should be proportionally booming as Melbourne’s population grows.

Also when the oldies eventually go into an actual nursing home, their houses are often sold to overseas buyers who can clearly afford the $3m plus price tag and all the expensive cars to go with it.

On the crash pad issue, I've seen plenty of boomers with town houses and the like in syd so they have an occasional city base when not in their country or beach house.

Yes and having the PPOR not count towards the pension assets test is a big incentive not to downsize so older people end up sitting in large family homes because if they move they lose their pension.

Yep, I live in a mere townhouse in a tombstone suburb. Poor policies such as no means testing on the family home and significant asset caps for couples and couples with a partner in care mean that they are entitles to hefty pensions while they maintain valuable assets- pensions can be $1200 a fortnight for a couple that only has food, utilities and the occasional expense. Another policy fail is home care packages, which entitle those who have been overwhelmed by their large home in old age to access tax payer funded butler service (gardening, near free meals, cleaning, car trips, daily activity support, unproven therapies like acupuncture and chiropractic - which is already available through health insurance). Most of this would be unnecessary if there were more policies encouraging down sizing. Some pensioners live it up in their overseas home land six months of the year for a fraction of the cost while their big suburban home is vacant or minded by kids for the remaining six months. Then when they eventually pass on, kids usually need the money for their own families, so sell up to developers and overseas buyers who build ugly greyge (grey-beige) Provincial homes. Not sure what kickbacks local councils get for approving these ghastly monstrosities in blue chip suburbs. The young get lumped with bigger taxes and being forced to live further from work to raise kids in a house with a yard (or something resembling that), then get their flexible work days cut as a reward.

Camberwell has lots of retirement/nursing homes but no hospital with a maternity ward so its not surprising that deaths within the suburb might outnumber births. It's why looking at births and deaths over a small area like a single suburb can lead to distorted results.

These trends also cause major issues. I'll talk about Melbourne because I know it best but we end up with really perverse outcomes. The majority of major infrastructure, in particular heavy and light rail, but also other health and critical services are concentrated in these suburbs. We pay huge amounts of money to fund this infrastructure and these becoming less dense when they need to be more dense is a huge issue. It makes no sense to have commuters coming from 1-2 hours from the CBD to work whilst people with great services a few km from the CBD are retired. Obviously there are issues with just plucking people from their neighbourhoods and networks but this issue needs to be resolved. It is not the solution, nor sustainable, for more and more people to be commuters from outer suburban / regional areas.

The easiest fix is just let people build whatever they want in these areas. Some retires will sell to developers, a few multi-storey blocks go up next to the trains and trams and pressure starts to get relieved before you know it.

It’s the damn grandfathered zero capital gain tax on homes owned before a certain year. They hold onto it as long as they can to maximise investment return, live there one day a week - yes as the city crash pad, instead of downsizing to an apartment. Meanwhile, preventing a family home from being available to a family. Ghost suburbs they should call them. Family homes hoarded and being used as inner city crash pads and investment vehicles.

Off the top of my head, outside of peak hours (ie most of the day) Lilydale and Belgrave lines are every 30 minutes. Late at night they stretch out to once an hour. Upfield even in peak time is every 20 minutes.

Might be others too, they’re just the three in most familiar with.

I live in Frankston and my regular office is Dandenong with job sites also at Cranbourne and Pakenham.

The fact that I would have to go to Caulfield to then go back out to Dandenong is absurd. The line ends not looping at minimum remains the biggest miss out in this area - especially as housing has filled in everywhere and all but destroyed the chance of this happening.

I've always found it pretty annoying that a land corridor wasn't set aside for heavy rail or light rail from Frankston/Cranbourne/Narre Warren/Berwick when they had the chance.

It would open the area up if there was fast interconnections down that part of Melbourne.

The liberal candidates have outright declared they’ll bring people back into the CBD to work, AND rip up the bike lanes to accomodate traffic. What will they blame after the bike lanes are gone and traffic is still shit? All because they’ve dragged everyone into the centre of the city to work under the eye of Big Brother

Mixed use medium density is the way. Single level 2-3 bed apartments with accessibility (lifts, no steps/stairs to get in, wide doorways and walk in showers) with low maintenance outdoor space so people can stay in the areas they like and have the grand kids over, etc.

And similarly, a mix of 1-2 beds as well as larger apartments and townhouses so that young people and young families have ways to live in the desirable areas with short commutes and lots of existing utilities and amenities.

All of it with walkable/PTable groceries, cafes, chemists, health services. All the things that keep people independent even if they’re aging, disabled, have small children. Encouragement to stay out and active and participate.

I think a lot of people would be supportive of this if there was confidence in build quality. As someone who has lived in townhouses and apartments in inner-Melbourne before, they were paper-thin walls, poorly-insulated, and fitted out with cheap-looking fixtures and fittings. The convenience of being so close to everything is advantageous primarily to help minimise the time you actually want to spend in the over-priced hot/cold box you're paying a ridiculous amount to rent in.

Agreed, these things always come with the caveat of quality.

That’s a universal issue though, shithouse new build quality isn’t unique to apartments—plenty of crap houses with paper thin interior walls and structural issues up the wazoo within a couple of years been thrown up ever further from the cbd. Even shitty apartments at least you’re not in the car for half an hour to get to the closest shops, or commuting for 90 minutes a day on a sardine train to get to work.

100%.

I bought a new two bedroom apartment in Brunswick East a few years back that was a great build (award winning), really lovely community, right on top of a dog park, 500m from Lygon and smack bang on a great tram line.

Our apartment was a few steps away from the lift and staircase that took you to a beautiful big rooftop garden where I'd play with my daughter or catch up with one of the other 70 apartment residents for a Friday arvo or weekend beer.

I absolutely loved living there. 

But we outgrew it and bought a 4 bedroom house in Coburg, about 100m north of Brunswick.

I love our house. But I was happier in that 2 bedroom apartment. I really miss the sense of community.

The complex does have 3 bedroom apartments, and one 4 bedroom one, but no one is selling those for a while.

Anyway, long story short. You don't need a big house on a big block to be happy. 

If an apartment complex is done right, it can give you just as good a quality of life.

The problem is that they're very rare apparently.

Better for the environment, and costs taxpayers much less than suburban sprawl, too! Way more sustainable by both metrics. Medium density/high density living consumes less resources, and requires comparatively less infrastructure too (which in turn: uses less resources!).

Outer suburban sprawl needs to plumbed, connected to electricity, needs roads, public transport etc etc. Built up areas still need that, but have a much smaller footprint comparatively, and tend to generate more tax revenue than they cost. It might seem counter intuitive, but an apartment building in an inner suburb is greener and cheaper, than a house in a leafy sprawling suburb.

I like apartment living, but it suffers from the same issues as housing design in Australia generally: poor quality builds, with a focus on maximum short term gain, over long term sustainability/liveability. Add a touch of NIMBYism (“nooooo! You can’t build here, it’ll devalue my home. Also: what if the poors move in?!”) and it feels like it’ll take some effort to win the Aussie public over.

The sad part is that singles are not as well off as couples in older age when it comes to pension asset test and entitlements. Often singles are women who have raised kids as solo parents, they get less super accumulation than men and end up paying more to live solo in later life. Whereas couples who are in their 80’s and 90’s now may not have paid as much in tax, as men were working and women were often home makers. While it’s still working at home, it doesn’t bring in tax revenue to pay for pensions.

You are completely right. There might be a few apartments built on the most exposed and unpleasant main Roads in Camberwell, but try venturing into anywhere with trees or existing 1-2 story housing and you will be immediately faced with the ‘no inappropriate development’ brigade.

The Council spent from 2016 to 2021 placing Heritage Overlays on every single building that qualifies that didn’t already have a Heritage Overlay on it. In this period 5,000 additional buildings were nominated and approved for Heritage Overlay - an increase of 50%. From 10,000 to 15,000.

You will never hear about this significant increase from Boroondara Council - to be specific - you will not hear about the increase from the elected Boroondara Councillors. At the last election all current Councillors ran on Heritage Platform’s. This provides easy votes for them. They are absolutely not publicising to local residents that there are no more houses left which meet the thresholds for Heritage Overlay (unless the legislation changes). If they told residents this, they would no longer get these easy votes and would have to find different platforms ti run on.

Its a huge paradox The Councillors have delivered exactly what residents wanted. But Resident’s will not be told about their hugely successful activities - as then the Councillors will not be able to run on Heritage Platforms. I’m sure there is a name for this, but haven’t studied politics or strategy, so don’t know what to call it.

My partner and I are in a situation where his parents are offering to help us buy a house, which is great, but as long as we “prove” we are living frugally. There is also no time limit on how long we must prove ourselves for before they will help us. Basically, they said if we go abroad, go to dinner, go to concerts, buy birthday gifts, even replace broken furniture etc they’ll pull the offer. Tbh I think they’re getting some weird pleasure from it all and it sort of sucks, but I can’t see us buying a house in the foreseeable future without some parental assistance.

Edit to add they’re aren’t buying us a house or even giving us the deposit outright, they’re helping with the deposit with the condition they own a portion of the house that is equal to the money they give

Spoiler - in 5 years time they turn around and say, "look at all your savings! See, that's a house deposit and it's all thanks to us!"

OP, please don't do this. Helping you with the deposit in return for an ownership stake in your house and controlling your lifestyle? Fuck that noise, it's a way of them exerting control over you. You will never be free of them, and no amount of money is worth them having this over your head in perpetuity.

Agreed. This is just an attempt at financial abuse. Just wait for the ghouls to die then you can finally own a house.

That sounds horrible but once they buy you a house you can stop living their required lifestyle.

EDIT - after seeing your edit - so it's not any sort of gift, they effectively want to be co-owners of your house and they aren't going to deign to co-own with you unless you live the way they think you should? That would be a big no thanks from me.

Well they’re not buying us a house but helping with the deposit, with the condition they own a portion of the house equivalent to what they gave us. But you’re right, I’m focusing on the end goal but it’s very “you can’t afford a house because you eat avocado toast” vibes from them

The idea that this will create sleepy town syndrome seems less likely given we have pretty good public transport.

You might not be able to afford to live in toorak if you are a barista but you can live somewhere on the train or tram. Much harder in more geographically isolated regional towns

Toorak was always quite sleepy though, it's never had a vibrant, young scene. It's elderly, conservative and houses the genuinely rich.

And that's possibly why it's relatively affordable to flat there, it's quite boring. I used to live in South Yarra and had friends that move out as soon as they have kids.

Personally think these are some of the best suburbs to live in as a single/couple - but everyone wants to live in the cool areas.

Theyve started realizing that the people who actually do all those service jobs in their area that support their comfortable retirement and lifestyle cant afford to live anywhere close enough to actually work there so everything starts to fall apart.

They still wont change anything to try and make it better though.

Man, Canterbury was like this years ago. Single old people living in these giant homes just waiting to die. Incredibly expensive cars everywhere and they'd back right into you anytime they wanted.

Back in the day the asshole residents of Canterbury decided to hire an ex QC to fight the local highschool which was expanding on to a block of land the highschool already owned.

They were arguing that kids from outside the suburb were being bussed into Canterbury.

Which... of course they were. Because the number of young families in Canterbury was nearly zero due to the stupidly high house prices and zero mobility.

We really need to replace stamp duty with land taxes to help free up a lot of homes so people live in places suitable for their stage of life. A single Grandma doesn't need a four-bedroom home and in many cases would be happy to downsize if there were good options available.

Otherwise you just end up with these dead places, no young people around, NIMBY gone crazy.

There has not been inaction. There has been active decision making around maintaining the current system and ensuring the wealth continues to coalesce into one corner of the population.

Capital in the monetary sense?

I rather disagree. You can't build what you want in most places. If developers could throw up a 20 floor with 200 apartments, they would - but funnily enough even many YIMBYs would object to a new tower going up next door and argue for something "smaller".

Believe you meant, if Capital could build anything they want this housing crises would be over in a few years.

Out in Mitcham - when walking in the evening it feels like 1/10 houses at least is vacant or no signs of life inside Ie lights/sounds etc being from the west previously there were more younger kids out n abt maybe it's just perception or just the typical things older ppl dont do

I also live in Mitcham - been here for 12 years - and it's slowly turning into a tombstone suburb for Chinese retirees. The Mitcham strip shops are basically Asian food, Asian medicine, massage parlours, Asian marts, and banh mis everywhere. We have a crappy pub and one fish and chip shop, a tai joint and I think 3 souvlaki joints. Even the milk bar was turned into a cafe called the "Milk Bar". And when I go for a walk most people a good hundred meters away coming your direction will cross to the other side of the road just to avoid looking at you. It was not like this 12 years ago.

I'm in Wantirna South and a similar thing is happening here. Nearly every house that gets sold is bought by wealthy Chinese, and they are insular as hell. Not to say they're bad neighbours - never had any issues and they're polite and all - but it feels like it's becoming a very specific enclave and that feels uncomfortable, to say the least.

So to avoid these quiet sleepy towns, and “tombstone suburbs” why can’t the houses be made cheaper so after the old residents die, younger people buy them move into them? I know I’m really young and learning more about this but there’s something fundamental in the process that I’m missing :(

The only thing you're missing is this cuntry is built on the logic of "arrow must go up" economics at all costs. No matter the real world consequences our overlords will ensure that they personally make money and that's it.

Everybody accepts if you gamble money at the casino and lose it's your fault. If you gamble on the footy and lose its your fault, if you gamble on the stock market and lose its your fault but gambling with land? Nahnahnah nobody's allowed to lose a cent on that, the system is literally stacked to ensure that slumlandlords will make profit no matter how badly and shortsightedly they gamble.

How do you just 'make houses cheaper'? Are you suggesting the government takes ownership of homes after deceased estate, then sells at their new set price, which is not market price? How do you determine what age of death is suitable to occur? 

How do you deal with anyone still living in the home (and if your suggestion is any home that has no further residents is to be compulsorily acquired, how are you going to deal with the inevitable shifting of families split into 2 or more homes just so they can hold onto it. How are you going to deal with people who sell at market price before death so that their descendants don't lose the money?). 

Things sell at market price, simple as that. You can use levers to change what market price could be (ie supply and demand) but you can't tell the market what the price is.
