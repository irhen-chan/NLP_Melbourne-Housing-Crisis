Is it just me, or does Melbourne seem to have a huge housing supply? Nearly every outer suburb has massive new estates popping up with rows of houses. So why do we keep hearing that there’s an undersupply of housing
VIC
Serious question does anyone know?

Did you see 300 000 of these new houses?

Because that's how much the population of Victoria has risen in just the last 5 years.

In fairness, it's not one person per house. But you also have to take into account how many people have died or gone into aged care or alternate arrangements.

Would be interesting to know the exacts figures.

Here’s the data for the last 5 years to March 2024. Net increase of 184,000. Doesn’t include the last 12 months, so add some more.

Average of ~3 people per household 184,000/3 =61,333.

Over the last five years (ending March 2024), Victoria’s population has seen a net increase of approximately 184,000 people.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown:

Population Growth: Victoria’s Estimated Resident Population (ERP) increased by 184,000 people between March 2023 and March 2024.

Growth Rate: This represents a growth rate of 2.7% over the year to March 2024.

Population Size: As of March 2024, Victoria’s population is estimated at 6.959 million.

Comparison to other states: Western Australia grew faster than any other jurisdiction over the year to March 2024 (3.1 per cent), followed by Victoria (2.7 per cent) and Queensland (2.5 per cent).

Melbourne’s Growth: Melbourne had the largest increase (142,600) in population growth among Australian capital cities in 2023-24.

It's simple, not enough, but Melbourne often leads the way and if there is a massive amount of supply w will see things swing fast. Sometimes there is a gap between the time work is done and house built and the data showing up.

Not a lot of people want to live in those places. It lacks infrastructure and community. Also those places tend to be very far from where people work or study. My friend lives in Mernda and it takes him about an 1 hour and 20 minutes to go to university and back

Because everyone wants to live 30 mins away from the city. I live in one of these new estates and honestly I couldnt be happier. We have a massive 4 bedroom house, decent backyard and lots of green space around us. Traffic is no worse than inner suburbs and I take the train anyway. Sure you give up on the hustle bustle and your vegan macha latte cafe, but its better than living in a grimy shoebox in the inner burbs. I do feel like we are living in Punjab sometimes, but I dont care 😂 coz my neighbours send me yummy food

I saw a YouTube on one of these estates, where the guy was at the Donnybrook train station trying to get to work, the trains come every hour, and he'd been waiting an hour and half as the previous train had been cancelled. Buses to the train station also only come every hour and there is almost no parking.

I've also driven there in the opposite direction during peak times, and it's a carpark, probably 2-3 hours for a one way commute to the city, so that is up to 6 hours a day commuting to work.

Also limited infrastructure, schools or anything of that sort.

Sounds like a miserable existence to me, but sure, people are just being picky.

That train station needs to be upgraded and part of the metro service, Wallan too. It’s already metro in craigieburn so it’s not that much further.

The distance from wallan to craigieburn is about the same as the distance from craigieburn to the CBD, extending metro all the way out there isn't really viable. Donnybrook maybe, but the depot is in Craigieburn so you'd end up with a pretty poor quality service out there anyway.

The fact is those estates in Donnybrook should never have been built. There's no elegant way to unfuck that situation.

I’m currently working in Craigieburn, live in Doreen and the best way home sometimes is via Donnybrook rd, it’s fucking outrageous how bad the they’ve fucked things out this way, they’re turned a 20-25 minute drive into 50 minutes. At least with Donnybrook they’ve got room to put in a train depot, they certainly have the room in Wallan. They just did that in Mernda after extending the Epping line. Need to duplicate a bunch of roads out this way too.

Exactly, and that’s part of the issue. A lack of affordable housing.

Where can I find amenities and a great lifestyle with public transport in walking distance 1.5 hours from the city?

It’s not about ‘having it all’ - we live in a country where housing shouldn’t be unaffordable. We should all have access to quality housing surrounded by amenities in walkable cities.

Haha they’re not picky about location, they’re extremely picky about houses. How many Indians do you know that live in a blue chip established suburb, in an older house?

They’d prefer to live in the middle of nowhere, so long as they have a 5 bedroom 5 bathroom 2 storey Carlisle Homes house. It’s all about status and appearances.

Yeap 100% indian land bankers buy up the farm land and cycle it through developers and real estate agents selling off the plan house and land packages, and mainly gets distributed into their networks.

Drive from Tarneit towards Melton, you'll see alot of the farm land SOLD by indian agents ready for the next wave.

Depends if you have an office job. If you can with remotely you just use that time to get some work and shorten your office hours.

Also tho, nobody WANTS to waste time on the train. The whole point of being rich is to suffer fewer inconveniences. The average person lives a more comfortable life than royalty of the past but people will still find something to complain about.

The real estate industry always lobbies on the fake supply issue because they want more land released to make money. The real issue with affordability is everyone wants to live within 20k of the city. I do, but no new supply there as built up decades ago

Outer suburbs are more affordable. And if you are near a vline, you can get to the city quite easily for work. My colleague lives way past woodend in vic and still travels in to the city. They actually find it relaxing on the vline. However, it is a different lifestyle you will live compared to inner city. Colleague used to live in the city before kids.

Some younger individuals want a different lifestyle to what the boring burbs offer. So it will be harder for them to move outer suburbs. You will find families with kids or couples who want to start a family move to the burbs more often than a SINK or a DINK as they want to be among similar peers and the lifestyle which the inner city offers.

Even if there is oversupply in West and North, it doesnt mean everyone wants to live there. From what I have seen majority of FHB’s still want to buy in a good suburb closer to CBD if they can afford it… Good suburbs will always have undersupply and huge demand so prices would increase and bad suburbs will always have oversupply and less demand so prices will keep low….

Pretty much, that and the large supply of apartments mean that there are some relatively well priced places in Melbourne. But half the complaints are I shouldn't have to live in Tarneit, I don't want to live in an apartment. It's the immigrants fault I can't live in Fitzroy or Hawthorn.

This!!! I think the same thing. I think most are not finished yet. But they are coming to it, then I reckon oversupply is gonna be an issue. I reckon they're feeding us with shortage information so we buy up because of it. Typical fear tactics to get the people to do what they want.

It’s cos a lot of city dwellers want to only move to south east or want a house with a garden in 600-700 range in inner suburbs which is insane 😂 when we were buying a house, my husband wanted to move to south east and was so adamant on it bcs it’s more connected and near work but with the crime spree and issues. I’m good with our 450 sq house in west in a really good walkable area, literally there are two schools and two child care centres 15 mins walk from my house and the station is 5 mins car drive away. The estate does have more Indian/Punjabi people but I don’t mind it bcs feels way more secure.

You hear about an undersupply because it suits the agents and their commissions, the bankers and their profits, and the politicians and their economic statistics and investments. When a downturn arrives, they will all be mystified at the "sudden" oversupply and start busily blaming everyone but themselves.

The answers are

it’s not enough still. I can have 10,000 kilos of food but if the demand is 12,000 is that 10K KG really huge?

not everyone wants to live in new estates with shite infrastructure and shittier public transport/commute to the city.

Because they “aren’t the houses” the entitled want…I hear so many first home buyers wanting 4 beds, 2 baths, on 1000sqm block, 15 mins from the city - and if it’s not available at $500k - then it’s (insert govt, boomers, council) fault.

That is the answer. The people crying about house prices don’t wanna compromise at all. I know a person who literally cannot afford but is happy to pay $1000 per week renting in the city rather than buying a house 20kms away from the city 🤷‍♀️ Reeks of entitlement

This argument only works if the houses mentioned aren't occupied. But they are.
