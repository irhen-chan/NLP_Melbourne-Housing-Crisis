Why Melbourne must evolve
Vibrant cities are those that evolve and endure—evolve by keeping up with
the changing and growing needs of the people they serve, and endure by
retaining the characteristics that attracted people in the first place.
Founded on land that Aboriginal people have lived on for at least
40,000 years, Melbourne is a vibrant city that has evolved and endured
for more than 180 years. What began as a settlement on the muddy
banks of the Yarra has gone through generations of change—including
the wild years of the Gold Rush, the wealth of Marvellous Melbourne, the
devastation of the 1890s depression, the shocks of two World Wars and
the Great Depression, the post-War migrant boom and the awakening of
the 1956 Olympics, and, now, another boom in investment and population
driven by the opportunities of the Asian Century.
Along the way, Melbourne developed a unique character, winning renown
as a multicultural and tolerant, liveable and affordable, sporting and
creative city.
Those characteristics made Melbourne one of the marvels of the 19th
century and a major financial services hub in the late 20th and early 21st
centuries. In the decades ahead, Melbourne must evolve again in order to
endure—retaining its marvellous liveability and culture while continuing
to be a global city of the 21st century

How we will plan for Melbourne
Managing population growth
There will be more clarity about where growth will
go. Population and housing growth will be kept
within the existing urban growth boundary by
the careful development of growth areas and the
selective redevelopment of underutilised areas
within existing communities.
Growing the economy
There will be more jobs close to where people live;
which is more important than ever in a changing
economy. Opportunities for new industries will be
created through the redevelopment of strategic
sites close to central Melbourne, through the
creation of national employment and innovation
clusters, and through the strengthening of
existing precincts for sectors such as health,
education, large manufacturing and freight
and logistics.
Creating affordable and accessible housing
There will be more affordability and choice, as
more of the housing we need is delivered in the
right places.
Improving transport
We will continue to invest in our transport
network — building the Metro Tunnel and major
road projects across the city and suburbs.
Government will respond to Infrastructure
Victoria’s independent assessment of
transport priorities by mid-2017.
Responding to climate change
Victoria will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions
to net zero by 2050. The city and state will also
grow a cleaner economy while preparing for
higher temperatures and more frequent extreme
weather events.
Connecting communities
Melbourne will be a city of 20-minute
neighbourhoods. Residents will still commute
out of their area for work, but most of their daily
needs will be a short walk, bike ride or public
transport trip away

How Plan Melbourne works
Plan Melbourne is a long‑term vision with a tangible implementation plan
It is a 35-year blueprint to ensure Melbourne grows more sustainable, productive and liveable as its
population approaches 8 million.
The implementation plan is a separate five-year plan of actions that need to be taken to make the
ambitions of the Plan a reality.
The five-year Implementation Plan will be regularly updated to keep up with the needs of Melbourne
as it grows. It will also be refreshed every five years.
The 35-year Plan Melbourne is a formal planning document to guide planners, councils, developers
and the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).
To achieve this, Plan Melbourne is structured around:
9 principles
