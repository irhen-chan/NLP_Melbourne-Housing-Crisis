It's funny how often you hear people say 'I'm concerned about housing options for our kids' right before they tell you all the reasons why building new houses is a terrible idea.

There's so much demand in the property market now there's no way house prices would stagnate due to apartments being built. They are generally considered a separate segment of the housing market to detached houses anyway, we have already seen at times apartment and house prices go in different directions.

Apartment values stagnate because they don’t meet the expectations of owner occupiers. They’re all shoddily built (with special levy surprises coming your way eventually) and small, with cramped living spaces, small bedrooms, no storage and minimal kitchens that seem like an afterthought. It’s like developers think the only people interested in living in apartments are 1990s yuppie stereotypes who eat out every night, spend long hours in the office and will get married and move to the suburbs in a couple of years time. They are not a house alternative. If they were better built and had practical, specious floor plans that made them comfortable, liveable homes, they would compete with houses more

Yep, there are almost no 4 bedroom apartments, very few 3 bedroom apartments. We've build apartments with the idea that they would be a stepping stone for young people to live in before getting a house in the suburbs to raise a family in.

One of the reasons for this is car parking requirements. A 4 bedroom apartment needs 3 car parking spaces in most of Melbourne which costs about $180K to build and takes up the same amount of space as a 2 bedroom apartment that you now can't build.

Most houses in the inner city are 3 bed or less (there are 1 bed terraces). I’ve lived in older 2 bedroom apartments that were spacious homes and it’s the little things; room for a dining table, a separate toilet, a proper kitchen with bench space, a hall cupboard for linen and towels and so on. I even lived in one with a separate laundry (great for storing things like the vacuum, cleaning products, mops, ironing board and a pet bed etc). They were the sort of home you could host a dinner and drinks for six people in without it being cramped and sad.

Three and four bedroom apartments that aren’t hyper-expensive luxe penthouses are rare, especially in Melbourne. Townhouses do exist, I guess, but don’t offer much density benefit over a regular house.

The parking and allowances for cars really bothers me because apartments should be part of a transit-oriented development or be in a walkable neighbourhood, or the building of apartments should be conducive to creating a walkable, transit oriented neighbourhood. Therefore a family of 4 would only need to have one car, or no car at all even. The Australian mindset is “2 car family when the kids are little and then a car each for the kids when they leave school” and it will be hard to break that. Inner city Melbourne and Sydney are the only places in Australia where not owning a car is a desirable lifestyle choice and it’s quite common for a household to not have a car.

Issue is the size vs cost. Current apartment build costs for developers are in the region of $3.5K - $4K per M2 excluding land cost. Take a typical (fairly small, medium quality) 2 bed 105 M2 apartment; that will cost the developer roughly $400K just to build. Add a profit you get to around $560-580. Which is already at or over the limit that the market will support. If you go any larger 2 bed'es will creep up into the +$650 which no one will buy.

Yeah it makes no sense. Growth requires change. Otherwise, without change there’s no growth and without growth there’s just stagnation. Just because change feels scary sometimes doesn’t mean it’s bad

I know this might be controversial, but as someone who really loves beautiful old houses I’d love to see more suburbs integrating old buildings into newer medium density housing rather than having a binary choice between old house on big block or ugly big modern shitty apartment blocks.

Well and a lot of these places the "older homes" are 1960s-1970s shit construction that would be tear down rebuilds anyways.
Better to combine a couple of lots and build a 3 storey, 6 unit small apartment building than build huge monstrous single family homes.

They’re often not allowed to because of strict visual regulations for new buildings. Same reason we end up with tiered apartments and multi-material facades to “break up the mass” of an apartment building rather than one cohesive material like the old days. 

I would encourage anyone to watch the YIMBY Melbourne discussion on this subject called Unbanning Beauty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLqJwwLpeVc

those visual regulations are absolutely bollocks and only used when the person with an idea has not enough money! the amount of times that I have seen old but still functional houses been demolished and right in between 2 lots of old houses you now have an apartment building that is 3 floors and grey in grey.

visual my arse it’s about money and no one in the council cares about how the street looks like when the money pot is full.

I’d actually say no. We all love the buildings but suburbs covered with them aren’t productive.

No point going wow these houses are all beautiful….wait I can’t live in this area because asking price is $2m minimum, no units or townhouses so I guess I’ll live in Clyde.

I inspected an apartment once that was built behind the facade of a heritage-listed building. It was awful, because they couldn't make the facade better so they had to do weird stuff like have a window from the bedroom into the lounge room to allow enough natural light to reach the bedroom to meet requirements.

the new activity centres would not change heritage overlays or policies

Doesn't stop heritage listed places from mysteriously catching fire though... Such as the Harris Flats on Barkers Road in Hawthorn (near the Ikea across the river in Richmond) which police believe to have been a deliberately lit fire.

I'd fully expect to see more of them mysteriously catch fire or suffer other catastrophic damage, especially when the possibilities afterwards can be so lucrative. Whatever gets built where the Harris Flats were will easily make a fortune with city skyline views over the Yarra.

Personally I reckon anyone who does that should be prevented from being able to profit from the site from that point on. They should only be able to recover the amount they paid for the previously heritage property, and the profits from anything built there subsequently should be forfeited... Maybe forfeit them to the state government so long as the funds are hypothecated towards maintenance of heritage listed public buildings?

I think if it happens then the land should be forfeited to the government to be used to benefit the community in some way. Whether it's social housing, or a public park, or a performing arts space, or whatever.

Well said.

Growing up in a very different part of the city than hawthorn we had a special overlay put on a spot near us for the comm games. It wasn’t selected by the state government but then the whole precinct was burnt down by the owners of one part and they “intimidated” anyone who attempted to get the police to charge them. Owners of the other parts of the precinct intimidated into selling.

Got a development approved initially. Built something quite different. Made off like bandits. Shithouse development.

That said it is want the worst thing to happen to the neighbourhood in that time at all but the developers and arsonist owners were absolutely criminal.

If you want to know what a fucking rort the heritage system is look at Flemington Bridge Station. It's heritage listed. Not because it's important but because the previous station was apparently important. The station that doesn't exist any more.

Here's what it looks like:

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flemington-Bridge-Station-Melbourne.jpg

What happened when they wanted to add a ramp to make it wheelchair accessible? The heritage consultants had to come and charge rate payers thousands of dollars to work out whether or not that affect the non-existent train station.

What happens when you ask heritage consultants if you should be allowed touch a property without paying them or their mates in the same field thousands of dollars? They think you should fucking pay them!

They are parasites who should be done away with.

That PDF clearly lists the reasons for listing as:

• The 1944 weatherboard station building

• The downside platform (but not the fencing, seating or platform lighting)

• The 1885 embankment

It provides reasons for the 1944 station building to be heritage listed based on its own attributes (and being one of the last of its kind), not it being in the original's place. That is absolutely not what you claimed it was. Don't lie.

This is a functional piece of infrastructure that a heritage consultant tried to make less functional so a building they that no living person can remember and doesn't exist can be preserved.

That PDF clearly lists the reasons for listing as:

First thing they mention when asking "Why is it significant?" is a building that doesn't fucking exist:

The Flemington Bridge Railway Station and embankment was first built in 1885 at a site between two railway bridges over Flemington and Mt Alexander Roads.

Here's the second paragraph about why it's significant:

The down (outbound) side platform, weatherboard building and embankment has historical significance for its association with the development and establishment of the early suburban railway line from North Melbourne to Coburg (now extending to Upfield) and the agitation by local residents for better train services in the area during the 1880s and then in the mid-1930s.

You might notice this also doesn't fucking exist.

Let's have a look at the reasons.

• The 1885 embankment

So firstly this is a pile of dirt.

• The downside platform (but not the fencing, seating or platform lighting)

This is an ashphalt slab.

• The 1944 weatherboard station building

This is a piece of shit weatherboard building they put there to stop the rain falling on people.

and being one of the last of its kind

Actually there's fucking heaps of them, there's only one in Moonee Ponds

Here are the bits about the station that still exist:

This was all accessed by timber steps leading up the embankment to elevated platforms. In 1944, a Victoria Railways produced a drawing to provide a simplified station arrangement on the two platforms; on the up side a 66 foot long weatherboarded building with a platform entrance way part way through it and on the down side, a 33 foot building with an entrance through the middle. Both sides of the station were accessed by long ramps in much the same location as today, doing away with the stairs which existed previously (Plan, Public Records Office Victoria, VPRS 4986/R1/430).

...

Plans for the new station buildings show the buildings further to the west with the long-awaited ramps to replace the timber stairs (Plan, Public Records Office Victoria, VPRS 4986/R1/430, SG1032 148). The new buildings were in place by 1945. Aerial photographer Charles Pratt captured an image of the new station, in 1950-55 which shows the new layout and design (Charles Pratt, “Aerial view of Flemington and Racecourse Roads, Vic,” ca.1950-55, State Library of Victoria).

I'm just going to copy and paste the bits about the station that no longer exists.

Flemington Bridge Station is situated between Racecourse and Mt Alexander Roads atop an embankment overlooking Moonee Ponds Creek to the north and Boundary Road to the south. Located along the Upfield line, Flemington Bridge Railway Station was constructed in 1885, after the train line then known as the North Melbourne-Coburg line (North Melbourne Advertiser, 12 Sept 1884, p.3; North Melbourne Advertiser, 30 Oct 1885, p.2).

The North Melbourne–Coburg line was completed in 1883 (The Age, 20 July 1882; North Melbourne Advertiser, 6 March 1885, p.3). In 1890, the North Melbourne Tramline was constructed, and like the early omnibuses and horse tramways, terminated at Flemington Bridge (Weekly Times, 8 March 1890, p.4; The Herald, 1 Nov 1890, p.2). In the 1920s, the establishment of Essendon Airport increased vehicular traffic along Mt Alexander Road, resulting in the expansion of the road in 1929 (The Argus, 14 June 1924, p.27; The Argus, 19 May 1936, p.8).

The construction of the North Melbourne– Coburg line was put into motion following the passage of the 1880 Railway Construction Bill put together by then Railways Commissioner, Sir James Patterson, who also served as Victoria’s premier (Andrew Ward, Upfield Railway Heritage Study, 1990, p.6; Mercury and Weekly Courier, 30 Sept 1882, p.2). The growing population in Melbourne’s north made passage of the bill sensible, with Patterson cited as saying, “I say it is the duty of the State to consider the reasonable requirements, with regard to railway accommodation in Melbourne and its suburbs” (Andrew Ward, Upfield Railway Heritage Study, 1990, p.6).

Part of the railway construction included embanking along Moonee Ponds Creek, atop which Flemington Bridge Station would later be situated. On either end of the embankment were cast iron bridges some 40 feet and 66 feet wide, passing over Racecourse/ Flemington and Mt Alexander Roads respectively (The Argus, 3 Feb 1887, p.9; The Argus, 7 Aug 1926, p.34). These bridges were likely similar to the bridge at the end of Flemington Road, which was extended to 99 feet in 1929 to cater for a widening of the road across Moonee Ponds Creek (The Argus, 7 Aug 1926, p.34; The Argus, 16 March 1928, p.17). At the same time, a new truss bridge was constructed on the up-end (city side) of Flemington Bridge Station. The structure was assembled piece by piece, then winched along the incline until fitted into position with the old track removed and the cast iron heads of the old cast iron bridge “blasted off with gelignite” (The Argus, 7 June 1929, p.9; The Argus, 10 June 1929, p.7).

Moonee Valley Heritage Study 2023 6

At the time of the opening of the line from North Melbourne to Coburg, there was no railway station located at Flemington Bridge. The closest stations at the time were Royal Park and Macaulay (North Melbourne Advertiser, 2 Jan 1885, p.3). The station had been completed in 1885 as a group of timber buildings high up on the raised embankment, accessed by ramps and steps. No plan has been sighted for this early group of buildings but from photographs and the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) plans it is evident that there was a main waiting building (possibly as men’s and women’s rooms) with an adjacent ticketing office and an outside earth closet (i.e. toilet) building at the far end.

Prior to the opening of the new line, local residents were already writing of the need for a new station at Flemington Bridge. In 1883, a petition was sent to the Minister of Railways signed by residents of Carlton, Hotham and Flemington with support of the local Council (North Melbourne Advertiser, 2 Nov 1883, p.3). A newspaper correspondent in January 1885 best outlined the cause, stating:

“In my opinion, the Flemington bridge is the proper place for the station, and on the following ground I base reasons: 1st. The extensive traffic (…) 2nd. The Flemington site is the most central and being near the bus route is already an established locale, and equidistant between two stations, more central and altogether more convenient for the public than the Macauly road site (North Melbourne Advertiser, 2 Jan 1885, p.3).”

By February, construction was underway on the new station, while Council debated possible names including Flemington, Flemington Bridge and Hotham West, and by December, the station commenced taking passengers Moonee Valley Heritage Study 2023 7 (North Melbourne Advertiser, 13 Feb 1885, p.2; 30 Oct 1885, p.2). At the time, the station existed as only platforms, with residents and representatives again calling on the Railway Department to construct station accommodation (The Age, 15 July 1886, p.7; The Herald, 14 July 1886, p.3).

The first station buildings erected at Flemington Bridge Station were constructed by William Blackwood in 1886 (Victorian Government Gazette, 1 Oct 1886, p.2811). The MMBW plan of 1903 shows the station buildings situated on the eastern portion of the embankment, closer to Mt Alexander Road than the current station buildings (MMBW Plan No. 853, 1903). Entry to the station was made from Boundary and Mt Alexander Roads, up a series of stairs.

The construction of station buildings, however, did not stop local input particularly in the interwar period. Residents wrote to the papers calling the station “unsightly,” a “second hand stop,” and “positively dangerous (The Argus, 2 Feb 1938, p.2; North Melbourne Courier, 4 Aug 1899, p.2; The Age, 6 May 1936, p.10).” One such resident described the station in 1936 (The Age, 6 May 1936, p.10), writing:

“Perched high up in the air, and proclaiming its unloveliness to the world, Flemington-bridge railway station stands as an eyesore and a disgrace to a department that sounds the loud timbrel about progressiveness. The approaches to this dilapidated and desolate looking crow’s nest consist of long flights of steps that grow older each day, while the hearts of the railway travellers who mount them grow colder. The platforms, if they can be called such, are wooden relics of days that are dead and gone. The shelters consist of narrow strips of roofs that provide but scant protection for the dejected frequenters when the winter rains are pelting down; when winds cut to the marrow, and the general outlook on life is bleak and black.”

Multiple break-ins certainly did not help these perceptions (The Age, 6 Feb 1888, p.5; The Herald, 1 March 1905, p.3; The Age, 16 Oct 1936, p.9). Criticism seemed to have reached a head in 1944, when an Independent Labour representative from Coburg called the station “a standing disgrace to the Victorian railways system” (The Argus, 18 Oct 1944, p. 5). By this time, a new station design was in the works, which took on board some of this public input.

Which one is longer?

An org I'm involved with is currently seeking 150 year old floor boards that are required to replace the current ones that literally have holes in them. There's not much of that stuff left and refurbs will literally become impossible soon. The consultants also suggested undoing changes that were made prior to the 50s (with photographic evidence) to return to the golden 50s era.

And don't get me started on random old houses that are heritage listed simply because they're old even though they have fuck all historical significance.

Meanwhile developers can burn down legit heritage buildings and get a slap on the wrist.

Know someone who ran a business in a heritage building. They wanted to move a lightbulb. It's a structural change so Heritage Victoria needs to be involved. The landlord's managing agent and the landlord both wanted to bring in their own engineer engineer along with the tenant having to provide one.

Expected cost? $30k.

I forget the specifics, but it had to be aged similarly and the same type of wood to the current floor boards which are now 160 years old. Not sure how much variance they allow.

There are companies that specialise in this but $$$.

Exactly, state governments are not going to magically lift planning scheme overlays, without going through a formal amendment processes with some form of public consultation.

Mr Arbon was so angry at the real estate agent's brochure in his letterbox that he ripped it up.

Wow, Mr Arbon must feel very strongly about this if he's (checks notes) ripping up brochures.

No one should care what NIMBYs think. The only issue I have currently is with the talk of companies cutting cost on construction leading to poor quality apartment builds. Genuine heritage builds can stay but there's no point in having whole suburbs of nice-looking mansions when most people can't afford to live in them. Suburbs exclusively for out of touch rich folks isolated from society and its problems is a great way for wealth to keep driving society apart.

They vote, at higher rates than young people that can't afford homes.

My dad's house in the UK was built in 1889 so I always find it funny when someone in Melbourne says a 1950s house counts as history.

In 1950 they might have felt the same way about a house built in 1889. Only 60 years old.

That 50's house is already 75 years old.

Well 95% of heritage overlays represent houses built from the 1850s to 1930s. The only 50s houses that are protected are modernist architect-designed ones, not your typical brick-veneer. There are next to no heritage overlays in areas where the latter predominate (because people don't care to preserve them).

Plenty of houses in camberwell were built between 1880 and 1920. If you go out to Blackburn you'll get the 1950s houses, but that's twice as far from the city.

I live in a house in Hughesdale and I welcome more housing. I just want it to be quality low/medium density apartments l, i.e 4-8 stories and with accommodation that has enough two to three bedroom accommodation for families and aren't just filled with one bed room shoe boxes with thin walls and poor facilities.

These people irritate me to no end. South Yarra has a nice mix of high and low density dwellings, and people don't seem to sh*t on it. I personally think the high rises have added to the 'character' of the suburb.

My criticisms of the Vic Labor housing policies are numerous and I don't think that these large scale zoning blocks will always work as intended. As the article points out, developments are expensive and it requires developers to actually want to go ahead with the build. And if they do, are we just going to end up with situations where up to 8000 apartments sit empty and unsold because they are shit? (https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-melbourne-suburbs-with-hundreds-of-cheap-brand-new-apartments-20250329-p5lni7.html)

Quality, normal sized apartments should be standard, but I am not seeing that in the legislation (happy to be corrected if I am wrong).

Not only that, there are huge vacant blocks of land, underdeveloped blocks and old warehouses that sit ever so slightly out of these "activity zones" that should be prioritised for developments. That is certainly the case in the north.

Fix the transport before you create more congested wastelands. We don't need high density housing if it's not serviced by PT.

Have you actually seen where the government want to build up new apartments? They're in the best PT serviced areas in Melbourne so saying they need to fix the PT is redundant.

How many more people do we need in Australia?

Do we want Australia to have 30 million people?

50 million?

100 million?

What's our food and water capacity to support a population?

What's the plan here?

Do we even have a plan? Or is it just about growing corporate profits now via growing consumption, worry about the greater impact on future generations later?

It’s better to do a mix of housing so you don’t end up with giant tower blocks nowhere near anything that are grey and depressing. Housing in VIC used to (don’t know if they do now) buy like one unit in a residential small block and making it public housing, making it easier for people to live in communities with access to things with everyone else who isn’t just a “poor”. /s One of our family friends had this arrangement and spent a lovely decade in st kilda in a lovely building with friends and ties to the local community etc.

This is developer centric conversation again. There are ample old shitty buildings and factories that aren't heritage listed in these areas that could easily be used for redevelopment. Always trying to turn the public against heritage when it's clearly not the issue
