so how bad is the rental market out there?
Real estate/Renting
Just got word that the property we rent is going to be sold - tell me straight folks - what's been your experience with finding somewhere to rent? How long were you looking before you found something? How many applications before being accepted?

I'm trying to get an idea of the size of anxiety I'm facing down in a few weeks, please dont pull your punches, give me the bitter shitty truths of it all. Thanks Melb

It depends. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúgood‚Äù applicant and have never made an unsuccessful application. But I have good income and cash in the bank. If you can demonstrate that then you‚Äôll be fine. If you‚Äôre relying on your next pay coming in on time then you‚Äôll have a harder time‚Ä¶ but then it all comes back to demand. Trying to rent a 1/2br apartment in a trendy suburb? Tough. Rundown house in the outer suburbs or CBD studio? You‚Äôll be fine

I applied for a dozen or so before I moved here, so interstate and got quite a lot of calls back. Only issue was they wanted physical inspections which I couldn‚Äôt do and when I could, the times didn‚Äôt line up with the person who was helping me by going to them.

I would say if your salary is in line with the price you want to rent and you have a few weeks to look, you‚Äôll be okay.

Single, average salary, dog, rent is 33% of my salary for a 2bd/1bath/older home in Sunshine.

Really depends on your income and what you‚Äôre looking for, but I freaked out and applied for a few properties over a weekend in December and was accepted for every single one. Picked my favourite, but they did have a lot of applications. Offered $10/week over the advertised rent, paying normally (not a few months upfront). No cover letter or any of that nonsense, the rental agency didn‚Äôt even ask for bank statements.

I‚Äôm 38, decent wage, decent savings, single woman, rent is 1/4 of my income.

Thats from the government website, but also I said I was looking in December so this is still a moot point.

I‚Äôve had a look at this and you have misunderstood. This bans rent bidding which was already banned I thought. Which is where an agent solicits higher offers. There is nothing illegal about offering more than is advertised if it is unsolicited.

I just moved into a rental unit here from interstate (NSW) and was looking in the CBD and surrounding suburbs mid-Feb for around 3 weeks. From what I can tell, there's A LOT of cheaper (relative, I came from Sydney ü•≤) small studio units mainly catering to students. Not all of them require you to be a student especially now that there seems to be an oversupply due to international student visa restrictions. I've already seen some listings repriced lower after a couple of weeks being advertised. So there's that, but again, these are very small ones where most of the time you won't even have space to put a wardrobe. There wasn't a lot of unfurnished studio or 1br options but I now realise that Feb is not the best time to be looking for rentals.

Best advice I got is to have the application ready before going to the inspection. Submit it right after if you like the place. A lot of people will qualify for the property but most property managers only look at around 5 applications so you'd generally want to be one of those 5. You could always withdraw if you change your mind anyway.

I have never been turned down an application but I am on paper a ‚Äúgood‚Äù applicant, I just show my savings and pay slips and get accepted straight away.. no kids, no pets.

If you are in a similar situation you will be fine, although I recently was hunting and at the places advertised for under $500 a week there were crowds of 30 +, going over $500 every $25 increase the crowds got smaller and smaller. This is along st Kilda road and around Albert park

It really bad at the moment for me even with several good references. I had to compete with several other applicants who offered over the weekly asking price.

Close to the city where I work. But there are probably cheaper rentals around Dandenong and Sunshine.

Lots of ppl have already mentioned that your luck finding a new rental is very individual. My only advice is to make sure you know your rental rights in case finding a new place takes longer than anticipated. I work in housing and it can take some ppl months to find a new property, others can be really lucky and it happens quickly. We also say to always inspect every property you apply for as well. You will have a local housing access point if you wanted to speak with qualified workers too, which can include funding for rent in advance if you're short on savings. Good luck!

One the things i did was to apply for the property, even if it was just listed and attend the inspection on the dates the real estate provided. This will have a higher chance of putting your application first to the agent, and if they see what they like, will pass on your details to the landlord. Real estate agent are not going to go through 100s of application, so better to apply right away so they can see your application.

It's very manageable as long as you're not looking in the trendy suburbs. If you search 10-15km out of the city, it's only a 30-40 minute train ride in, and you can find rents at roughly $250-300 per room.

I actually had the same thing happen to me two weeks ago, and it wasn‚Äôt as dire as I initially thought. That said, our current place is great‚Äîvery affordable rent‚Äîso in that context, it was a tougher decision. From what I understand, the market isn‚Äôt as bad as it was a couple of years ago.

My top tip, and something that I think helped us seal the deal, is to engage with the viewing agent during inspections. If you find a place you like, ask them questions and strike up a conversation. It‚Äôs surprising how many people just walk in, inspect the house, and leave without saying much. Even if you don‚Äôt necessarily need the answers, use the opportunity to chat and give them a sense of who you are. That way, when your application comes in, they‚Äôll remember you.

It‚Äôs definitely not as dire as it once was!

We just moved about a month ago, and it was not as bad as I had been preparing myself for. We're definitely "good on paper" (married couple, no kids, stable incomes, good rental history), we applied for one place we really really liked and missed out on - but there were about 40 people at the inspection. We applied for another that was not in our most preferred location but a good house, we got it and it's actually worked out well. Have all your ducks in a row for your applications, be prepared to look outside what you think is ideal and you'll be ok.

It depends on area/property and amount. My first property I inspected, I pre applied to show I was keen, provided a cover letter just incase and got the property. Single female, stable job, excellent rental history and no pets at the time.

I started looking a bit over a month before I had to move. The first 8 applications were all knocked back. After I paid for the Id verification fee I ended up being accepted for 3 properties. Granted this also couldn't been because it was closer to my preferred move date (about 2 weeks out)

All competition is at the bottom end of the market.

If you have the coin for it, you can move into a long-term serviced apartment tomorrow morning

Hey OP, we were just in the same boat. Was looking in Moonee Ponds/Flemington/Kensington/Brunswick West area, took us about 5 weeks to find a new place after a few rejections (granted we were away for 2.5 weeks during that period).

We have fairly good income, but we do have a cat. I guess what helped is that we started attaching proof of savings in addition to income, and got lucky with the last place we inspected.

Some places esp the high density ones should have multiple units available, if you‚Äôre not too picky about the area/property (we were..) and on a stable income, you should be good even if it feels stressful for now. Best of luck!

Sorry that happened to you. I have been forced on too, twice in two years. The first time, I was forced to move from a house to an apartment due to massive rent increases. The second time, my apartment was sold. It's the sales inspections that suck.

Every time I enter the market, both the prices and the options get worse. I'm probably just bitter for being treated like cattle, but I would just give up and move away, or board with friends or family if you can.

As for the ability to actually get a lease, I've always had my first application accepted. Only the "low" end places have a lot of competition at inspections. To give you an idea, an extra $50 per week pricetag meant two other people showed up for an inspection vs 20 other people at the cheaper places. I think less people show up when it's raining, too. So that helps.

Depends where you're looking. Inner suburbs are pretty cooked, but outer suburbs seem pretty well stocked. Anecdotally ive had friends find and get accepted for places in the outer burbs (Macleod, Greensborough) pretty much immediately.

You will be spending more on a rental, likely to what you are paying now. Unless you move a bit further out

Took us 4 days to secure a place after we started looking. We are in our early 40s with no children working fulltime. We did list 2 dogs and a cat on the application. We also offer $30 more per week than the asking price.
