Is anyone else genuinely struggling knowing they’ll never being able to buy a house in Melbourne?
Serious Please Comment Nicely
Sorry if it’s been posted before. I’m a first home buyer, 29, employed full time/ no kids but even still I feel completely hopeless about ever owning a house and being able to live anywhere in Melbourne and it’s causing me genuine depression. Just wondering if anyone else can relate?

Absolutely 41, 2 kids. Slaved my ass off have enough for a deposit on a house but if we buy won't have money to live all we will be doing is servicing a loan.

I'm pushing 40, 1 kid, started earning 6 figures for the first time in my life recently. Still need to save another $20-30k just to get enough of a deposit for a 5% (plus fees) mortgage on a house within a 45-60 minute commute to my work.

Yes, I am stressed about ever owning a house, and stressed about how much it will be to pay off once I am able to get one.

In a way, we're all modern-day serfs and the banks are the new feudal lords.

Banks are not the feudal lords. I sympathise with you as I have children that will need to buy homes. The LNP are the enablers that enable speculators to use the tax system to subsidise their bets on housing going up. Johnny Howard famously said a couple of decades ago that no home-owner complained that house prices were going up. So its clear the political class values home owners more than renters. As a class, renters need to aggregate their votes to make a change. One clear step is stop voting LNP.

For my part, I moved to Australia from Canada in 1995 because house prices were going up 30% per annum and it was becoming wildly unaffordable. Imagine my surprise that a good 4 bedroom home in Glen Iris could be had for $350k in the late ‘90s. It would easily be ten times that by now. What drove it? Capital gains tax concessions and negative gearing. We were very lucky to get into the market on a decent salary. Buying in Glen Iris took 3 times my salary. The Rule of Thumb I grew up with was a house should cost 3 times your gross salary.

So if I was in your shoes, I would be looking to move to places where your money goes much further. Look at southern Europe. France, Spain and Italy are so desperate for people that houses are going for pennies on the dollar. Even the US is much more affordable than here. Australia looses because young, educated people end up leaving. Don’t fall into the trap of going huge on mortgage and then being trapped for decades. Its not worth it. Good life styles, good societies, good living can be achieved by getting out from under Australian Gov’t conservative (Boomer) policies. I am a boomer, but I think its shameful what is being done to young people these days with student debt, housing costs, salaries etc. Don’t put up with it.

I don’t think it’s feasible for people to up and leave to another country so easily. Furthermore, it’s pretty f**cked up that an Australian should have to leave their birth country just to afford housing, sorry, but that’s a ridiculous take.

It is a ridiculous take (and this is from someone who did leave Australia for a decade as I couldn’t get work in my industry here).

It’s likely that in buying a house in the 90s in Glen Iris at $350k, the commenter was on an above average salary/household income at the time (average single person salary in Australian metro areas was $29.5k in 1995).

When I bought a few years ago, I bought a place in the country, not too far from the beach, with a rail connection and under 200 km from the capital (closer to regional cities). I did spend around $500k, but I got a place that would be in the $4M - $6M in the capital city now. The building rate in the town is more than twice the national average - there are quite a lot of people choosing to move out of the major cities.

It’s not for everyone, but I’ll be damned if I’ll live just to service a mortgage.

Rule of thumb is 3 times your annual salary? What era are you talking about? 1950? I'm on $110k and and please tell me where I could buy a house for $330k.. Butt fuck nowhere within 200km of the CBD

Sorry, don't mean to sound that rude but the youth are screwed. Even the pits of Melbourne are now min 500k. We're all here to simply feed the machines. Slave away your whole life to own a box called home.

France, Spain and Italy

"France, Spain and Italy" are not cheap at all to buy, unless you plan on living somewhere rural where there is little to no work and few facilities. Those pennie houses are close to being scams that locals will not touch. It's tough everywhere but financially easier in Aus in general than in those three countries when taking into account the average wage difference vs difference in cost to buy.

I am sure the OP could find a cheaper home in the outback too. Easier then leaving your home country, learning a new language and culture. Much of the problem is affordable housing where people want to live snd work

Agreed, which is the same challenge people are facing in those mentioned European countries. No one in Paris/Barcelona/Milan are enjoying their 2 hour commute to work as they are forced to buy/rent on the outskirts. Maybe they are similarly talking about how wouldn't it be great to buy a cheaper home in the Australian outback and live a simpler life.

Median house price in Shepparton is $350k AUD.

No offence, but it was the generation who decided to use housing a means to profit that is the main cause. Imagine if everyone that owns one, two or three houses (which is a decent sized portion of my mum and dad's generation) decided to invest in the stock market rather than using basic living as means for gains from those who have less.

I have these arguments with my dad all the time. There's a part of population who are set and doing well, and there's a younger generation who have to hand over what would be there mortgage savings to those people so they can retire nicely?

Sure there's politics and what not involved further exacerbating the issue, but at the end of it who's gaining the most? The people who the struggle town people have to pay their rent too.

It's pretty easy to see the rise in house prices go up with the popularity of using the housing market to make gains. Something only a certain generation and older had the money to do at the time, therefore pricing people of my generation and younger waaaaaay out of the housing market. Those that can are generally in a two income household.

Once upon a time I could of bought as a single man with a solo income but that's out of the question unless I pack up and move to rural Melbourne, but alas the fuel to constantly drive up to Melbourne all the time to help my sick parents and to just generally visit my friends and family, and all that would be purely based off if I could attain employment in the town I had to move too.

Sure moving somewhere were the dollar goes further sounds logical but it's not very feasible in this day and age

There's way more homeowners than renters and no homeowner is going to vote for the party that causes a decline in the value of their house. Forget inner-city latté liberals, forget climate change and regional jobs. We saw what happened to the ALP at the last election when they promised to ever so gently reform negative gearing.

Forget about political change. The only thing that will crash this bubble is monetary policy, by way of the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates. And sooner or later they will. When I left school they were 18% and no one anywhere was complaining about housing being too expensive to ever hope to own.

I bought my first home at 37 with my partner, both of us had been saving 10 years.

If I was single I would have probably just used my deposit to buy a home in a growth area to rent out and gain equity and just rented in an area I would rather live.

Buying a home on a single income without family money is out of reach for most people.

I'm in an area I like but it's still a compromise. When I wanted a place large enough to have a family I was under no illusion that I could ever afford in Hawthorn/Malvern where I was living at the time and loved living there.

I ended up moving to the north east where our combined income could afford.

I'd be compromising on the size and condition before area, within reason
